# Resources for NETS1037 - Monitoring and Log Management

## Course Information
This course is part of the INSS program at Georgian College. The course outline is updated periodically and kept available online via the [Georgian College website](https://georgiancollege.ca). There is also a course syllabus with the details for each semester kept on [Blackboard](https://gc.blackboard.com) for the course. Course communications, announcements, schedules, assignment submission links, and testing are conducted using [Blackboard](https://gc.blackboard.com).
    
There is no textbook for this course. Online videos and documentation provide the reference material.
We use multiple operating systems for our lab exercises and it is expected that students will run them in virtual machines under [VMWare](https://vmware.com) for which the college provides a license, or [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org) which is free from Oracle. Students are expected to install and become familiar with at least one of these software packages on their own.

## Overview
This course examines the purpose and use of logging and monitoring tools in modern networks from a security-oriented perspective with a focus on servers and infrastructure devices. This site provides course learning support materials and links to relevant companies, software, and organizations. This site is updated continuously while the course is being taught. Students bring varying levels of experience and knowledge to this course. Students who have experience with this topic will find everything they need to complete this course contained within the college-provided materials here on github and on Blackboard. For students with little or no experience with this topic, various links to suplemental and background information are included in the weekly materials. Additionally, a resource link list that is actively maintained and covers much more than the list of topics in this course can found at [https://github.com/0x4D31/awesome-threat-detection](https://github.com/0x4D31/awesome-threat-detection). The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) is an excellent resource to use when examining an existing deployment to identify concerns. None of the websites linked as resource materials are strictly required for the student to complete this course. They are provided solely to enhance and complement the materials.
