# NETS1037-08 - Unified Threat Management

## Overview
This lesson builds on the previous lessons to integrate the various technologies to control, and provide visibility into, network activity. It is expected to be completed in weeks 11 and 12 of the course, with the quiz due before the start of the following class. 

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
  * design and implement a unified threat management service
  * incorporate multiple protocols and approaches to traffic sanitization and monitoring into a single traffic choke point
  * capture traffic intelligence using the UTM service

These objectives are in support of Learning Outcomes 4 and 6 in the Course Outline.

## To do List
   * Read through the [presentation slides](Presentations/NETS1037-08-UnifiedThreatManagement.pdf)
   * Watch the recorded video of the presentation found in the general chat of the Microsoft Team for this course if you did not attend the class when it was presented
   * Review the lesson materials linked below
   * Perform the learning activities as described below
   * Do the quiz found under Tests on [Blackboard](https://gc.blackboard.com) for this topic

## Lesson Material
  * [Presentation slides in PDF format](Presentations/NETS1037-08-UnifiedThreatManagement.pdf)
  * Recorded video of the presentation found in the general chat of the Microsoft Team for this course

## Learning Activity
In this lab assignment, you will be creating a virtual machine for a Linux-based web application server, suitable for use in the rest of the assignments in this course. Follow the instructions in the [Lab 8 - Unified Threat Management](Labs/Lab08-UTM.html).

## Online Resources - documentation and examples for software used in this lab
* [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/)
* [E2Guardian](http://e2guardian.org/cms/index.php)

## Graded Activity
When you are done this lab, you can check the rubric for this assignment on [Blackboard](https://gc.blackboard.com) to ensure you have completed everything that is marked and then submit your work to Blackboard as described in the lab instructions.

## Quiz

The quiz is found on Blackboard under Assignments and Tests.

## Test

There is no separate test for this topic. The quiz will count for your testing mark in this topic.

## Summary
In this module, you have been introduced to SNMP and using SNMP as a data source for monitoring software.
You should now be able to:
  * design and implement a unified threat management service
  * incorporate multiple protocols and approaches to traffic sanitization and monitoring into a single traffic choke point
  * capture traffic intelligence using the UTM service

Completing the quiz will provide you with a measure of your knowledge in these areas. For the next class you should have your private virtual network ready, as well as your log server and Windows desktop client.
