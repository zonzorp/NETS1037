# NETS1037-01 - Introduction to Monitoring and Log Management

## Overview
This is the first lesson in the NETS1037 Monitoring and Log Management course. It is expected to be completed in week 1 of the course, with the quiz due before the start of the next class. Additionally you are expected to have created a virtual private network with a pfsense-based router on your own equipment before the next class. It is recommended to use either [VMWare](https://vmware.com) or [VirtualBox](https://virtualbox.org) for this. It is the student's responsibility to obtain, install, and become familiar with whatever virtualization programs and operating environments the student chooses to use.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
  * explain how logging and monitoring contribute to security management
  * distinguish between logging and monitoring activities
  * create a private virtual network with a pfsense-based firewall VM

These objectives are in support of Learning Outcomes 1, 2, and 3 in the Course Outline.

## To do List
   * Read through the [presentation slides](Presentations/NETS1037-01-Introduction.pdf)
   * Watch the recorded video of the presentation found in the general chat of the Microsoft Team for this course if you did not attend the class when it was presented
   * Review the lesson materials linked below
   * Perform the lab activities as described below
   * Do the quiz found under Tests on [Blackboard](https://gc.blackboard.com) for this topic

## Lesson Material
  * [Presentation slides in PDF format](Presentations/NETS1037-01-Introduction.pdf)
  * Recorded video of the presentation found in the general chat of the Microsoft Team for this course

## Learning Activity
In this lab assignment, you will be creating a virtual network with a router on it, suitable for use in the rest of the assignments in this course. Follow the instructions in the [Lab 1 LAN Setup](Labs/Lab01-LAN-Setup.html).

## Graded Activity
There is no separate grade for this lab assignment. In the next lab assignment, you will be adding a loghost to this virtual network as well as a Windows desktop machine. This virtual network will need to be functional before you can do that activity. When that lab is done, a part of the marks for that lab will be for the correct creation of this virtual network with router.

## Quiz
There is a quiz for this topic, found on [Blackboard](https://gc.blackboard.com) under Tests.

## Test
There is no separate test for this topic. The quiz will count for your testing mark in this topic.

## Summary
In this module, you have been introduced to monitoring and log management technologies.
You should now:
  * know the difference between logging and monitoring activities
  * understand how logging and monitoring contribute to security event management
  * have implemented a private virtual network for use in the assignment labs in this course

Completing the quiz will provide you with a measure of your knowledge in these areas. For the next class you should have your private virtual network ready.
