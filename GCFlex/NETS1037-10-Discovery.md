# NETS1037-10 - Network Discovery

## Overview
This lesson takes a brief look at network discovery. It is expected to be completed in week 14 of the course, with the quiz due before the end of the 14th class. 

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
  * identify machines connected to networks
  * identify machines transmitting on networks for which they are not authorized

These objectives are in support of Learning Outcomes 4 and 6 in the Course Outline.
