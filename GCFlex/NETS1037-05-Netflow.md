# NETS1037-05 - Netflow

## Overview
This lesson introduces the netflow protocol and the use of it to provide data sources for monitoring tools and network discovery. It is expected to be completed in week 8 of the course, with the quiz due before the start of the following class. 

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
  * describe the netflow protocol and related protocols and tools that implement both the data collection agent and the flow data transmission process
  * use software tools to monitor the state of systems and networks based on netflow data
  * implement a webapp and integrate it into the lab network to provide graphical flow data visualization tools

These objectives are in support of Learning Outcomes 2, 4, and 6 in the Course Outline.

## To do List
   * Read through the [presentation slides](Presentations/NETS1037-05-Netflow.pdf)
   * Watch the recorded video of the presentation found in the general chat of the Microsoft Team for this course if you did not attend the class when it was presented
   * Review the lesson materials linked below
   * Perform the learning activities as described below
   * Do the quiz found under Tests on [Blackboard](https://gc.blackboard.com) for this topic

## Lesson Material
  * [Presentation slides in PDF format](Presentations/NETS1037-05-Netflow.pdf)
  * Recorded video of the presentation found in the general chat of the Microsoft Team for this course

## Learning Activity
In this lab assignment, you will be creating a virtual machine for a Linux-based web application server, suitable for use in the rest of the assignments in this course. Follow the instructions in the [Lab 4 - Basic Monitoring and Netflow](Labs/Lab05-Basic-Monitoring-And-Netflow.html).

## Online Resources - documentation and examples for software used in this lab

## Graded Activity
When you are done this lab, you can check the rubric for this assignment on [Blackboard](https://gc.blackboard.com) to ensure you have completed everything that is marked and then submit your work to Blackboard as described in the lab instructions.

## Quiz

The quiz is found on Blackboard under Assignments and Tests.

## Test

There is no separate test for this topic. The quiz will count for your testing mark in this topic.

## Summary
In this module, you have been introduced to netflow and using netflow data for network traffic monitoring and discovery.
You should now be able to:
  * describe the netflow protocol and related protocols and tools that implement both the data collection agent and the flow data transmission process
  * use software tools to monitor the state of systems and networks based on netflow data
  * implement a webapp and integrate it into the lab network to provide graphical flow data visualization tools
Completing the quiz will provide you with a measure of your knowledge in these areas. For the next class you should have your private virtual network ready, as well as your log server and Windows desktop client.
