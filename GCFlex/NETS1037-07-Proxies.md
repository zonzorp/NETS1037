# NETS1037-07 - Proxy Services - Web-focused

## Overview
This lesson covers using proxy services to control, and provide visibility into, web-based network activity. It is expected to be completed in week 10 of the course, with the quiz due before the start of the following class. 

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
  * design and implement a web proxy service
  * use the proxy service to capture web traffic intelligence

These objectives are in support of Learning Outcomes 4 and 6 in the Course Outline.

## To do List
   * Read through the [presentation slides](Presentations/NETS1037-07-ProxyServices.pdf)
   * Watch the recorded video of the presentation found in the general chat of the Microsoft Team for this course if you did not attend the class when it was presented
   * Review the lesson materials linked below
   * Perform the learning activities as described below
   * Do the quiz found under Tests on [Blackboard](https://gc.blackboard.com) for this topic

## Lesson Material
  * [Presentation slides in PDF format](Presentations/NETS1037-07-ProxyServices.pdf)
  * Recorded video of the presentation found in the general chat of the Microsoft Team for this course

## Learning Activity
In this lab assignment, you will be creating a virtual machine for a Linux-based web application server, suitable for use in the rest of the assignments in this course. Follow the instructions in the [Lab 7 - Web Proxy](Labs/Lab07-Web-Proxy.html).

## Online Resources - documentation and examples for software used in this lab
* [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/)
* [Using Apache2 as a reverse proxy](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/reverse_proxy.html)
* [Issues and Concerns with transparent proxying](https://pharish.wordpress.com/2011/11/10/transparent-versus-non-transparent-proxying/)
* [Nginx reverse proxy](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/)

## Graded Activity
When you are done this lab, you can check the rubric for this assignment on [Blackboard](https://gc.blackboard.com) to ensure you have completed everything that is marked and then submit your work to Blackboard as described in the lab instructions.

## Quiz

The quiz is found on Blackboard under Assignments and Tests.

## Test

There is no separate test for this topic. The quiz will count for your testing mark in this topic.

## Summary
In this module, you have been introduced to SNMP and using SNMP as a data source for monitoring software.
You should now be able to:
  * design and implement a web proxy service using Apache2
  * use Apache2 as a reverse proxy service to capture web traffic intelligence

Completing the quiz will provide you with a measure of your knowledge in these areas. For the next class you should have your private virtual network ready, as well as your log server and Windows desktop client.
