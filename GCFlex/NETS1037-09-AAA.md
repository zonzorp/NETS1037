## Graded Activity
When you are done this lab, you can check the rubric for this assignment on [Blackboard](https://gc.blackboard.com) to ensure you have completed everything that is marked and then submit your work to Blackboard as described in the lab instructions.

## Quiz

The quiz is found on Blackboard under Assignments and Tests.

## Test

There is no separate test for this topic. The quiz will count for your testing mark in this topic.

## Summary
In this module, you have been introduced to SNMP and using SNMP as a data source for monitoring software.
You should now be able to:
  * evaluate and select from different authentication methods for remote access
  * implement a RADIUS service to provide AAA service to network edge access devices
  * verify proper user controls and logging for AAA-enabled access

Completing the quiz will provide you with a measure of your knowledge in these areas. For the next class you should have your private virtual network ready, as well as your log server and Windows desktop client.
