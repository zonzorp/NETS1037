# NETS1037-04 - SNMP and Monitoring

## Overview
This lesson introduces the SNMP protocol and the use of it to provide data sources for monitoring tools. It is expected to be completed in weeks 5 and 6 of the course, with the quiz due before the start of the following class. 

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
  * describe the SNMP protocol and tools that implement both the data collection agent and the data retrieval process
  * use software tools to monitor the state of systems and networks based on SNMP data collection
  * create a webapp server and integrate it into the lab network, to provide graphical network and systems monitoring tools

These objectives are in support of Learning Outcomes 4 and 5 in the Course Outline.

## To do List
   * Read through the [presentation slides](Presentations/NETS1037-04-SNMP.pdf)
   * Watch the recorded video of the presentation found in the general chat of the Microsoft Team for this course if you did not attend the class when it was presented
   * Review the lesson materials linked below
   * Perform the learning activities as described below
   * Do the quiz found under Tests on [Blackboard](https://gc.blackboard.com) for this topic

## Lesson Material
  * [Presentation slides in PDF format](Presentations/NETS1037-04-SNMP.pdf)
  * Recorded video of the presentation found in the general chat of the Microsoft Team for this course

## Learning Activity
In this lab assignment, you will be creating a virtual machine for a Linux-based web application server, suitable for use in the rest of the assignments in this course. Follow the instructions in the [Lab 4 - SNMP](Labs/Lab04-SNMP.html).

## Online Resources - documentation and examples for software used in this lab
* [SNMP](http://net-snmp.org)
* [SNMPv3 Options](http://www.net-snmp.org/wiki/index.php/TUT:SNMPv3_Options)

## Graded Activity
When you are done this lab, you can check the rubric for this assignment on [Blackboard](https://gc.blackboard.com) to ensure you have completed everything that is marked and then submit your work to Blackboard as described in the lab instructions.

## Quiz

The quiz is found on Blackboard under Assignments and Tests.

## Test

There is no separate test for this topic. The quiz will count for your testing mark in this topic.

## Summary
In this module, you have been introduced to SNMP and using SNMP as a data source for monitoring software.
You should now be able to:
  * demonstrate the SNMP protocol and tools that implement both the data collection agent and the data retrieval process
  * demonstrate software tools to monitor the state of systems and networks based on SNMP data collection
  * implement a webapp server and integrate it into the lab network, to provide graphical network and systems monitoring tools

Completing the quiz will provide you with a measure of your knowledge in these areas. For the next class you should have your private virtual network ready, as well as your log server and Windows desktop client.
